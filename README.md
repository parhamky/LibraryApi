# Backend Development Project - REST API with PostgreSQL, MySQL, Redis, Gin, and Gorm

This project is a REST API developed as part of the Backend Development course at Iran University of Science and Technology (IUST), CESA College. The API uses **PostgreSQL** and **MySQL** as databases, **Redis** for caching, and is built using the **Gin framework** and **Gorm** for ORM. The entire application is Dockerized for easy deployment and scalability.

## Features
- **Dual Database Support**: The API supports both PostgreSQL and MySQL databases, allowing flexibility in database choice.
- **Caching with Redis**: Implements Redis for caching frequently accessed data to improve performance.
- **RESTful API**: Follows REST principles for clean and scalable API design.
- **Dockerized**: The entire application is containerized using Docker for easy deployment and testing.
- **Gin Framework**: Utilizes the high-performance Gin framework for building the API.
- **Gorm ORM**: Uses Gorm for database operations, providing a clean and efficient way to interact with databases.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Backend Framework**: [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin)
- **ORM**: [Gorm](https://gorm.io/)
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MySQL
- **Caching**: Redis
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Programming Language**: Go (Golang)
- **Other Tools**: Git, GitHub, Docker Compose

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine.
- Git for version control.

### Steps to Run the Project
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the necessary environment variables (e.g., database credentials, Redis URL, etc.).
   Example:
   ```env
   POSTGRES_USER=your_user
   POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_password
   POSTGRES_DB=your_db
   REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
   ```

3. **Build and Run with Docker**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
   This command will build the Docker images and start the containers for the API, databases, and Redis.

4. **Access the API**:
   - The API will be running at `http://localhost:8080`.

---

## API Endpoints
Here are some of the key endpoints available in the API:

- **GET /users**: Fetch all users.
- **POST /users**: Create a new user.
- **GET /users/{id}**: Fetch a specific user by ID.
- **PUT /users/{id}**: Update a user by ID.
- **DELETE /users/{id}**: Delete a user by ID.

For a complete list of endpoints, refer to the [API Documentation](#) (if applicable).

---

## Dockerization
The project is fully Dockerized, with separate containers for:
- The Go application (API)
- PostgreSQL database
- MySQL database
- Redis cache

The `docker-compose.yml` file defines the services and their configurations. You can easily modify it to suit your needs.
